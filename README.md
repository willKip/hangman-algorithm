# Hangman Algorithm
Hangman solver algorithm functioning on a given word base.

Problem and base code was given by the COMP 1405z Fall 2020 offering at Carleton University, Ottawa.

## Usage
Clone to local directory with `git clone https://github.com/willKip/hangman-algorithm`; run `hangman.py`, and after a short delay the code will show the number of games played (modifiable with the `numgames` variable in `hangman.py`), and how many games managed to get the answer correct. Success rate is around 92%.
